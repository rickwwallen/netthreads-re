This implementation of the reference router uses a link between eth1 and the
first MAC port (nf2c0) to send packets to configure the router. But the DMA
link nf2c0 could be used as well (although we haven't tested that). The
communication protocol is based around reading and writing registers, with the
same numbering as in the original reference router.

Contributors welcomed:

1) It appears that the raw socket interface inserts packets in the stream
which give strange looking listip results once in a while. Those packets don't
appear in the tcpdump so this is strictly a host problem (the processor was
trace at runtime to validate that assumption and compared against the
simulator trace and a rtl simulation trace). When the first listip is not
blank, the user can expect the other listip to look funny.

---> I am now filtering those packets based on their size it the issue appears to be resolved.


2) The conversion of verilog to C was done in a 'best effort' manner and the
router has not be thoroughly tested.
