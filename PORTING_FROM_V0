Since NetThreads-RE only has one combined input and output packet buffer,
there is no need to memcpy packets. This explains briefly the impact on the
code (which should be shorter and simpler now).

To port an application from the previous NetThreads, here are the steps:

1) there is no more output buffer allocation. Packets are sent from the input memory.

The input memory is managed in hardware (except for the portion that is not
freed for used by the hardware).

When a packet is received, if it is dropped, make sure to call:
nf_pktin_free(packet_ptr);
to make the address of the received packet (packet_ptr) available for the
incoming packets.

2) add iomem_send.o to the list of objects in your program Makefile. 
it contains the function to call to send a packet. It requires that you do:
uint ctrl = calc_ctrl(start_addr, end_addr);
to compute the ctrl character for the sending.


See reference_router for a detailed example.
